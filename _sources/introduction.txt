motivepy: A Python API for communicating with OptiTrack cameras
---------------------------------------------------------------

## Why
The main goal of the API is to substitute the Motive GUI
whenever it is convenient.

For this we wrapped most of OptiTrack's C++ Motive SDK with Cython.
We tried to structure Motivepy as pythonic as possible and also
added some stability to the raw functionality of the original SDK.
In addition we developed some advanced features like a 3D viewer
script for tracked points.

## How
First note that Motivepy runs on 32bit as well as on 64bit. In the following
we only describe the 32bit case, but 64bit is analogous

###Installing Motive

Go to https://www.optitrack.com/downloads/ download and install Motive 1.9
(Or older. Newer versions should also work, but have not been tested).


### Installing Python

To use a Python API you need to install Python on your machine.
To run the converter script we recommend to install Python 2.7 (32 bit) and make sure it runs in the windows console
(i.e. open the Command Window and type *python*. If python starts, then it's installed!
If it is installed but not working, try and add the following adresses (or depending where you installed stuff) to the PATH variable::
  ```
  C:\Python27\; C:\Python27\Scripts\
  ```

### Installing Motive
To run our code we recommend to first download and install Motive 1.9

then install the Microsoft visual C++ compiler package for python 2.7,
then install Python 2.7.9 (we used 32bit) and add the following file adresses
(or depending where you installed stuff) to the PATH variable:

C:\Program Files (x86)\OptiTrack\Camera SDK\lib;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\

Then open a console, write pip install cython and hit enter.


To import the wrapped functionality into python, simply cd into your camerapy
folder, write python, hit enter, write import cam.native and hit enter.

After you changed code, cd into your camerapy folder, write python setup.py build_ext --inplace
and hit enter (if you receive an error message about a dll missing, simply download that dll and
copy it into the System32 folder).

Njoy!
